# Vintage Techmeetup 


A <a href="https://twitter.com/alistairhann/status/1302558977193111552">Tweet</a> triggered a discussion about <a href="https://vimeo.com/108571105">Charlie Boisseau's 2014 Techmeetup talk</a> on Internet Infrastructure. That triggered the temporary re-activation of Techmeetup's old Vimeo account. 

So for one month there is a chance to peruse the archive. Rewatch some great talks by some amazing people. People that stood up and shared their knowledge.

Below is just a list of the most viewed, but there is also <a href="https://vimeo.com/techmeetup">202 more</a> to check out.
